* TODO Expected features in the Genbank file
  SCHEDULED: <2009-11-27 Fri>
  Any Genbank (or other) file that would be rendered by the allele
  imaging logic should have a number of required features that allow
  us to classify all the features into specific segments of our image
  canvas. Each feature needs to specify the following:

  + type (e.g. rcmb_primer, exon)
    determines which row of our canvas the feature will get stached in
  + label (e.g. G5)
    determines what gets displayed in the labels row for the feature
  + location
    
  These aspects of the features are required for determining the
  column and row boundries. The recombineering primers (rcmb_primer)
  are required and should have one of the following labels to indicate
  which one they are:

   + G5
   + U5
   + U3/D3 -- D3 for deletions
   + G3

   These primers allow us to split our features into horizontal
   sections as follows:

   | 5' flank | G5 | 5' homology | U5 | cassette | U3/D3 | 3' homology |  G3 | 3' flank |

   In a conditional clone there is a loxP region between the target
   region and the 3' homology arm.

* TODO Canvas Matrix
  The image on the canvas will be broken into a matrix that would look
  something like the following table:

  {
    "row_1" : {
      "column_A" : "",
      "column_B" : "",
      "column_C" : "primer",
      "column_D" : "g5_homology_arm",
      "column_E" : "primer",
      "column_F" : "primers",
      "column_G" : "",
      "column_H" : "primer",
      "column_I" : "loxp_g3_homology_arm",
      "column_J" : "loxp_g3_homology_arm",
      "column_K" : "loxp_g3_homology_arm",
      "column_L" : "primer",
      "column_M" : "",
    },
    "row_2" : {
      "column_A" : "horiz_line+start_exons|curve",
      "column_B" : "horiz_line|+some_annotation_i_think_primer-AsiSt",
      "column_C" : "",
      "column_D" : "",
      "column_E" : "",
      "column_F" : "",
      "column_G" : "",
      "column_H" : "",
      "column_I" : "",
      "column_J" : "",
      "column_K" : "",
      "column_L" : "",
      "column_M" : "",
    },
    "row_3" : {
      "column_A" : "",
      "column_B" : "",
      "column_C" : "",
      "column_D" : "",
      "column_E" : "",
      "column_F" : "",
      "column_G" : "",
      "column_H" : "",
      "column_I" : "",
      "column_J" : "",
      "column_K" : "",
      "column_L" : "",
      "column_M" : "",
    },
    "row_4" : {
      "column_A" : "",
      "column_B" : "",
      "column_C" : "",
      "column_D" : "",
      "column_E" : "",
      "column_F" : "",
      "column_G" : "",
      "column_H" : "",
      "column_I" : "",
      "column_J" : "",
      "column_K" : "",
      "column_L" : "",
      "column_M" : "",
    },
    "row_5" : {
      "column_A" : "",
      "column_B" : "",
      "column_C" : "",
      "column_D" : "",
      "column_E" : "",
      "column_F" : "",
      "column_G" : "",
      "column_H" : "",
      "column_I" : "",
      "column_J" : "",
      "column_K" : "",
      "column_L" : "",
      "column_M" : "",
    },
  }

  The idea being that given a feature from a known type of allele
  (circular/linear), we can specify which segment/section of the
  canvas that our renderable feature would get rendered.
