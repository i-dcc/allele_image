* TODO Expected features in the Genbank file
  SCHEDULED: <2009-11-27 Fri>
  Any Genbank (or other) file that would be rendered by the allele
  imaging logic should have a number of required features that allow
  us to classify all the features into specific segments of our image
  canvas. Each feature needs to specify the following:

  + type (e.g. rcmb_primer, exon)
    determines which row of our canvas the feature will get stached in
  + label (e.g. G5)
    determines what gets displayed in the labels row for the feature
  + location
    
  These aspects of the features are required for determining the
  column and row boundries. The recombineering primers (rcmb_primer)
  are required and should have one of the following labels to indicate
  which one they are:

   + G5
   + U5
   + U3
   + D3
   + D5
   + G3

   These primers allow us to split our features into horizontal
   sections as follows:

   | 5' flank | G5 | 5' homology | U5 | cassette | U3 | target region | D5 | loxP site | D3 | 3' homology |  G3 | 3' flank |

   In a conditional clone there is a loxP region between the target
   region and the 3' homology arm and in a deletion there is no target
   region.

   The Genbank file also needs to specify whether or not the sequence
   is circular or linear.

   Each feature also has to have the label defined i.e not an empty
   string.
