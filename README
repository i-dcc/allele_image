=item Specification

Need to come up with a standard for defining our GenBank files. Any GenBank file
conforming to this standard should be renderable by our final code. On this note
we need to list the features we encounter and have some way of classifying them.

=item

Every image should contain the following regions/sections in this order:

    G5                U5       U3/D5   [D3]   G3
    | 5' homology arm | cassette | 3' homology |

=item

Depending on the "circular" flag, we may have to render:

    backbone     # where circular == true
    {3|5}' flank # where circular == false

=item i-dcc.org

Need to be able to render the i-dcc GenBank files as well.
See http://www.i-dcc.org/targ_rep/alleles/1 for an example GenBank file.
